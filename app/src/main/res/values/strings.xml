        Starfield, one of the most awaited games of the year that every RPG fan has long been waiting for is finally here. Eager fans with access have already geared up with Starfield-inspired accessories to get the full experience of the game. For the early impressions of the game, I played the title on PC and managed to get in around 9 hours of gameplay.

The initial 9 hours playing Starfield were really something as I have never felt such an extent of freedom in any other game. As with the primary promise of the game, where you can fly off to any planet you want and follow the story or journey the way you want it to go.

While a lot has already been said and debated about this freedom and the technical aspects of the game, I think the technicalities of how Bethesda offers you this freedom should not be the focus of the game. I know that I have not even scratched the surface of the main questline, but I still want to share my initial thoughts about the game.
